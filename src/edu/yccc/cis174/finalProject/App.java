	 * What I want to do in a nutshell: (Summary)
	 * 
	 * Basically, you try to guess the person based on your conversation with them.
	 * They tell you some of their info and you try to guess them based on that.
	 * Maybe before they try to guess you.
	 * You ask each other at least three questions, then you try to guess each other. 
	 * You guess first. Then they do. If you both get it wrong, another question must be asked.
	 * CAN I DO THAT!?
	 * 
	 * 1. Create characters.
	 * 2. Each character has a couple stats. Is that possible?
	 *
