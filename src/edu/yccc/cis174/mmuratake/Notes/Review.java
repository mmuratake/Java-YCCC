	// There's something called a constructor. Do you remember the problem it gave you, that you wanted one thing to take arguments but 
	// not the other thing? You can add two constructors, one where it takes arguments and the other where it doesn't.

	 * Arrays are a bucket of things, typically similar things.
	 * 		Limitations:
	 * 			- You have only a specific amount of data.
	 * 					> Can only take 1000 objects (or something like that)!
	 * 			- You need to know what you're going to put in there. You can't add things later!
	 * 					> Essentially, you specify things at the time of creation and can't revise it later.
	 * 
	 * Lists are pretty much the same thing, except:
	 * 			- Size doesn't matter.
	 * 			- Can grow or shrink at will.
